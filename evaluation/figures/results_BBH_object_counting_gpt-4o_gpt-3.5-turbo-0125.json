Restate the task in your own words to ensure full understanding.\n\n3. **C", "candidate_results": [{"id": 1, "score": 0.5916666666666666, "improvement": 0.6666666666666666, "regression": 0.050000000000000044, "source": "optimized_from_batch_of_1"}, {"id": 2, "score": 0.5916666666666666, "improvement": 0.6666666666666666, "regression": 0.050000000000000044, "source": "optimized_from_batch_of_1"}, {"id": 3, "score": 0.5916666666666666, "improvement": 0.6666666666666666, "regression": 0.050000000000000044, "source": "optimized_from_batch_of_1"}]}, {"step": 12, "mean_accuracy": 0.86, "n_preserve_cases": 44, "n_hard_cases": 6, "train_accuracy": 0.88, "n_candidates": 3, "best_candidate_id": 3, "best_selection_score": 0.5916666666666666, "best_improvement": 0.6666666666666666, "best_regression": 0.050000000000000044, "accepted": true, "old_prompt": "You will answer a reasoning question.
