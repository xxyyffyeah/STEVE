        "You will answer a reasoning question. Follow these steps to ensure accuracy and reliability:\n\n1. List all items mentioned in the question, regardless of perceived relevance, to ensure no omissions.\n2. Provide clear criteria for categorizing items as relevant or irrelevant, using examples or a decision tree to guide your decision.\n3. Restate the question in your own words to ensure comprehension of the context and requirements.\n4. Explicitly list all items and their quantities before performing any summation to prevent omissions or miscounts. State the reasoning behind categorizing each item as relevant or irrelevant.\n5. For each item, state its category and quantity, then explicitly show the addition process, ensuring each step is clear and transparent.\n6. Double-check each arithmetic operation before proceeding to the next step, confirming that the intermediate sum matches the expected result.\n7. Verify the input data by cross-referencing with known facts or asking for user confirmation if any ambiguity is detected. Encourage user interaction for clarification if needed.\n8. Perform intermediate sum checks after adding each item, stating the current total and verifying it against the expected running total.\n9. Sum the quantities of relevant items directly from the list without additional calculations to avoid complexity and potential errors.\n10. Pay close attention to numbers and quantifiers in the text, ensuring they are correctly interpreted and included in the count.\n11. Be aware of singular and plural forms, and ensure numerical descriptors are accurately interpreted.\n12. After listing the items, ensure that the calculation directly reflects the listed items without discrepancies.\n13. Implement a self-check mechanism to identify potential errors in the prediction. If discrepancies are found, cross-reference with additional data sources or seek user clarification to correct the prediction.\n14. Recognize discrepancies between the calculated total and the expected total, setting a threshold for acceptable variance and re-evaluating if the variance exceeds this threshold.\n15. Provide a detailed breakdown of the calculation process, including listing each number being added and confirming the intermediate sums.\n16. Consider any contextual factors or constraints that might influence the count, such as spoilage or specific counting rules, and adjust the calculation accordingly. Check for implicit information or assumptions in the input.\n17. Reflect on previous errors in similar tasks and adjust your approach to improve accuracy in future responses. Recall similar past examples to inform your current reasoning process.\n18.

Document specific errors encountered and the corrective actions taken.\n23. Conduct a final audit by recounting all items and recalculating the total to ensure it matches the expected result. If discrepancies are found, re-evaluate the steps and calculations.\n24. Avoid using ambiguous symbols like ellipses unless clearly defined. If additional items are implied, list them explicitly or confirm their existence with the user.\n25. Perform a consistency check between the calculated total and the stated answer, comparing the final sum with the list of items to ensure alignment. Re-evaluate if discrepancies are found.\n26. Provide guidance on handling additional information or assumptions. If adding quantities not explicitly listed, state the rationale and confirm with the user.\n27. Encourage interactive verification with the user, asking for confirmation of the list of items or the final total, especially if any ambiguity or potential error is detected.\n28. Use examples or scenarios where similar errors have occurred and how they were resolved to enhance understanding and learning from past mistakes.\n29.
