First, identify the core question and distinguish between primary and secondary information to understand the specific context and intent. Pay special attention to key phrases or terms that might indicate specific contexts or conditions, such as dates and ages, to enhance contextual understanding. Define what constitutes a \"project\" for each entity, specifying categories such as TV shows, movies, specials, and spinoffs, and apply these definitions consistently. Evaluate the temporal context by assessing the timeline of events and their relevance to the current year or the year in question. Cross-reference multiple reliable sources for fact verification, listing potential sources and checking for consistency before finalizing the answer. Ensure all information directly contributes to the conclusion, explicitly stating how each piece supports the boolean answer. Structure the explanation in a step-by-step manner, ensuring each point logically leads to the conclusion. Recognize and address any hypothetical scenarios or specific conditions by identifying keywords or phrases that indicate such situations. Break down the question into logical components and evaluate each against the given conditions to determine the boolean outcome. Consider potential edge cases and how they might affect the outcome. Use precise language and clarify any terms that could be interpreted in multiple ways. Incorporate strategies for handling ambiguous queries, such as identifying potential ambiguities, seeking clarification, or providing a probabilistic answer when certainty is not achievable. Express confidence in the answer by providing a probability score or a statement of uncertainty when not fully confident, prompting further verification or clarification. Be aware of common biases and heuristics, critically evaluating their applicability to the specific case and considering exceptions to general rules. Reflect on training data to recall previous similar questions and their resolutions, applying learned patterns to new queries. After formulating an initial response, verify the answer by cross-referencing with a reliable knowledge base to ensure accuracy. Perform a self-assessment by reflecting on potential errors or misinterpretations, and adjust the response accordingly. Ensure alignment with the ground truth by checking the conclusion against a known correct answer or reliable source. Provide a clear and robust justification for the answer, exploring both direct and indirect factors. Use definitive language to avoid ambiguity and ensure logical consistency throughout the explanation. Focus on the specific query, filtering out extraneous details and concentrating on elements crucial to answering the question accurately. Use the following refined example as a reference for structuring your response: \"Given the conditions that [condition], the answer is [True/False] because [reasoning].\" Incorporate an iterative feedback and learning loop to refine understanding and improve accuracy over time, analyzing incorrect answers to identify errors and adjust strategies accordingly.",
        "Answer the following yes/no question. Begin with a clear 'Answer: True' or 'Answer: False' statement. First, identify the core question and distinguish between primary and secondary information to understand the specific context and intent. Ensure the initial answer is logically consistent with the provided data by performing a preliminary check. Pay special attention to key phrases or terms that might indicate specific contexts or conditions, such as dates and ages, to enhance contextual understanding.

Evaluate the temporal context by assessing the timeline of events and their relevance to the current year or the year in question. Cross-reference multiple reliable sources for fact verification, listing potential sources and checking for consistency before finalizing the answer.
