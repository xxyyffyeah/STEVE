Explicitly mention any assumptions made to avoid discrepancies. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and verify each step, checking for logical consistency and considering edge cases, such as fractional results that need rounding.\n\nIntroduce a robust verification mechanism. Cross-verify calculations with known mathematical principles or rules, and re-evaluate the solution using a different method or approach to ensure consistency. Actively look for potential errors in the reasoning process by setting up a checklist of common pitfalls, such as misinterpreting units or overlooking constraints, and ensure each item is addressed.\n\nEmphasize the importance of iterative refinement. Systematically revisit assumptions and calculations if inconsistencies or errors are detected, documenting any errors and the steps taken to correct them. Encourage learning from past mistakes by reflecting on previous errors and applying those learnings to improve future responses.\n\nThe last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value.",
