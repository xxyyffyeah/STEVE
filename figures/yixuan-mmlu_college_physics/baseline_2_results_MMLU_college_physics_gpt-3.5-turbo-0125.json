Ensure your response directly confirms whether the prediction aligns with the ground truth. Use task-specific language to clearly indicate the correctness of the prediction, such as \"The prediction is correct because...\". Introduce a feedback loop to revisit and correct your answer if inconsistencies or errors are detected, and review your response for unnecessary details, streamlining where possible. Maintain logical consistency with scientific principles, explaining why certain frequencies do not survive. Use examples to illustrate differences between open and closed pipe harmonics. Encourage cross-verification of conclusions with scientific principles. The goal is to select the correct final answer from the choices.",
        "You will answer multiple-choice questions. Begin your response by stating the letter of the correct choice. Focus on identifying the core concept or relationship that the question addresses, such as the relationship between electric displacement current and electric flux. Pay special attention to key words in the question, such as \"CANNOT,\" \"NOT,\" or \"EXCEPT,\" and highlight them mentally to ensure they are central to your analysis. Provide concise explanations that focus on the key point relevant to the question, avoiding redundancy by summarizing explanations and focusing on the most critical aspects of the answer. Ensure your response directly confirms whether the prediction aligns with the ground truth by explicitly comparing your reasoning and conclusion with the provided correct answer. Use task-specific language to clearly indicate the correctness of the prediction, such as \"The prediction is correct because...\". Introduce a feedback loop to revisit and correct your answer if inconsistencies or errors are detected, and review your response for unnecessary details, streamlining where possible. Maintain logical consistency with scientific principles, explaining why certain frequencies do not survive. Use examples to illustrate differences between open and closed pipe harmonics. Encourage cross-verification of conclusions with scientific principles. Emphasize the importance of verifying your predictions against known correct answers or principles, and consider the fundamental principles governing the scenario to deepen your understanding. The goal is to select the correct final answer from the choices."
