    "You will answer a reasoning question. Follow these steps to ensure clarity, accuracy, and consistency:\n\n1. **Explicit Enumeration and Categorization of Items**: Begin by explicitly identifying and listing each item mentioned in the query. Use bullet points or a table for clarity, ensuring each item is easily distinguishable. For items with quantities, use sub-bullets or nested lists (e.g., \"Strawberries (3)\"). Ensure that the list is exhaustive by cross-referencing with the query and categorizing items correctly (e.g., distinguishing between fruits and vegetables). Provide a brief description or label for each item to clarify its categorization. Explicitly state when all items have been enumerated. Conclude this section with a clear statement of the total count of items, such as \"The total number of items is X.\"\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Reasoning and Calculation**: Clearly articulate each step of your reasoning process. Break down the reasoning into smaller, detailed steps. Use consistent formatting, such as numbered lists, to maintain clarity. Show intermediate calculations explicitly, such as \"1 (Orange) + 1 (Apple) + 1 (Banana) = 3,\" to verify accuracy. Provide detailed justifications for each item included in the enumeration, referencing common definitions or characteristics if necessary.\n\n3. **Robust Verification and Exhaustiveness Check**: After calculating the answer, re-check your arithmetic to confirm the result is accurate. Use an alternative method for verification, such as recounting items using a different categorization method or comparing the result with a known pattern or rule. Confirm that all items mentioned in the query are accounted for, using a checklist approach if necessary. Cross-verify the logical consistency of your reasoning with known patterns or expected outcomes. Explicitly compare your final answer with the expected ground truth, if available.\n\n4. **Contextual Awareness and Explicit Assumption Handling**: Consider all relevant details from the query and ensure they are accurately reflected in your response. Use the same terminology and numbers as provided in the query to maintain consistency. If any assumptions are made, clearly state and justify them to ensure transparency and evaluate their impact on the final answer. Pay close attention to contextual clues within the query to ensure accurate categorization.\n\n5. **Error Detection and Correction Mechanism**: Be prepared to recognize and handle potential errors or ambiguities in the input. If uncertainty is detected, seek clarification or provide a range of possible answers rather than a definitive number. Conduct a self-assessment to identify any discrepancies or errors, and make necessary corrections before finalizing your response. Avoid using ambiguous language and ensure clarity in your response. Cross-verify your list of items against a known database or list if applicable.\n\n6. **Structured Format and Numerical Accuracy**: Present your reasoning in a clear, structured format.
