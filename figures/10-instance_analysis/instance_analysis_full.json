                    "1. **Explicit Counting Instructions**: The current prompt lacks explicit instructions on how to handle counting tasks, especially when dealing with plural forms and numerical quantifiers. Adding a directive that emphasizes the need to identify and count each item individually, including those expressed in plural form, can help. For example, instruct the model to \"Identify each object and count them individually, paying special attention to plural forms and numerical quantifiers.\"",

                    "2. **Parsing and Comprehension Guidance**: The prompt should guide the model to parse the input more effectively. Including a step that instructs the model to first list out all items mentioned in the input, distinguishing between singular and plural, can improve comprehension. For instance, \"First, list all objects mentioned, noting any quantities or plural forms, before proceeding to count.\"",

                    "",
                    "4. **Error Checking Mechanism**: Introduce a step in the prompt that encourages the model to review its initial response for potential errors.

To address this, the prompt could be modified to include a conditional instruction, such as: \"Provide a detailed breakdown only if the question is complex or if the breakdown adds clarity. Otherwise, provide a concise answer.\"",
