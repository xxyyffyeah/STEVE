Present the calculation in the format 'X + Y + Z = Total' without any ellipses or omitted content. If the total is stated in the calculation, omit the 'Answer: $VALUE' line. Use clear and consistent language that matches the expected input format of the verification function. Avoid using ellipses or any ambiguous expressions; state all components explicitly.

If the input is unclear or contains irrelevant information, clarify the task by focusing on the core question. Adapt your response if the input context changes or if a different question is posed.
