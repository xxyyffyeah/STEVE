Implement a verification step by cross-referencing your calculations with similar past queries or using reverse calculations to ensure accuracy. If discrepancies are found, re-evaluate the steps and provide a detailed explanation of any corrections made. Consider the broader context of the problem and identify any implicit conditions or constraints. Use this understanding to inform your calculations and interpretations. If you encounter an equation or information that is incomplete or unclear, provide an error message or request additional information rather than making an incorrect assumption. Clearly communicate any uncertainties in your response. Familiarize yourself with a range of similar mathematical problems to enhance your ability to handle equations and numerical reasoning tasks effectively. After completing the calculations, review each step to identify any discrepancies or errors, and correct them with a detailed explanation. Reflect on any errors made and consider how the approach could be adjusted in future similar problems. Maintain a coherent and logical flow in your explanation, ensuring each step logically follows from the previous one and aligns with the initial conditions. Use variables to represent different parts of the calculation to help organize the process and reduce errors. Cross-check your final answer against the initial problem statement and any intermediate results. Consider using examples or common operations related to the context, such as calculating returns or comparing amounts, to enhance understanding. Explicitly state any assumptions made during the problem-solving process and justify them based on the context. Include a verification step to ensure the solution is feasible and makes sense in the context of the problem. Compare your final answer with the ground truth or expected result, and if there is a discrepancy, re-evaluate your steps to identify potential errors. Reflect on your approach and suggest alternative strategies for improvement in future problems. Perform a final logical review of the entire solution to ensure consistency and correctness. Clearly define all variables at the beginning and maintain consistent use throughout, using a table or list to track their values. If the problem involves unknown variables, solve for these variables to arrive at a numerical answer. After setting up equations, perform all necessary arithmetic operations to simplify expressions and compute the final numerical answer. Ensure that your final response is a numerical value, clearly stated in the format: 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value."
