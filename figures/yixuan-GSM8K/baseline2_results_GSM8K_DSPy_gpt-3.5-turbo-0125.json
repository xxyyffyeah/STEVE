After each step, ask yourself questions like \"Have I accounted for all conditions mentioned in the problem?\" or \"Does this result make logical sense given the context?\" Perform a quick verification step to ensure your result matches expected patterns or known results, and provide a logical explanation for any differences.\n\nIncorporate examples or analogies to draw parallels with similar problems you have solved correctly, aiding in pattern recognition and applying the correct logic to new problems. Introduce a mechanism that alerts you when your answer does not match expected patterns or known results, prompting a re-evaluation of calculations if discrepancies are detected.\n\nEmphasize the importance of logical reasoning, encouraging not only the performance of calculations but also an understanding of the underlying logic of the problem. Be aware of common pitfalls, such as misinterpreting percentages or failing to subtract correctly. Actively look for and utilize contextual clues within the problem statement to guide your reasoning process. Identify any potential ambiguities or assumptions in the problem statement and clarify them in your response.\n\nEnsure consistent answer formatting across different queries by presenting the final answer as a plain numerical value, regardless of the complexity of the problem. Reinforce this consistency to maintain uniformity in responses. Use the phrase \"Result:\" followed by the numerical answer to ensure quick identification.\n\nExplicitly list each component of the calculation, including the cost per unit and the total for each component, to ensure transparency and ease of identifying discrepancies. Emphasize the importance of using consistent units and formats for all monetary values to prevent errors in summation and ensure clarity in the final answer.\n\nEncourage users to double-check the calculation, especially if the result significantly deviates from expected values, serving as a final safeguard against errors and enhancing user confidence in the response.\n\nThe last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Result: VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value. Ensure it is presented as a plain numerical value without any additional formatting. Avoid using ellipses or incomplete expressions; ensure each calculation step is fully detailed and explained. If input values appear unusually high or low, include a note or prompt for verification to ensure data accuracy. Clearly state any assumptions made during calculations, such as the number of cookies per tray, to provide context and enhance transparency. Provide a brief explanation of the reasoning behind each calculation step to aid user understanding and learning.", "Begin by restating the problem in full to ensure clarity and context. You will answer a mathematical reasoning question that involves both calculation and logical reasoning. Assess the complexity of the problem to determine the level of detail required in your explanation. For simpler problems, provide only the essential calculation steps and the final answer, minimizing additional context unless absolutely necessary. For more complex problems, restate the problem in simpler terms if necessary, and highlight key elements such as breaks or specific conditions affecting calculations.\n\nYour primary task is to calculate the total number of marks, not the number of students. Prioritize clarity and conciseness in your explanation, focusing on essential steps that directly contribute to understanding the solution. Define all variables clearly, specifying what each represents in relation to the problem statement, and maintain consistency in unit usage throughout your response.\n\nBreak down the problem into smaller, manageable steps, explicitly stating each calculation and its purpose. Use straightforward expressions and punctuation, avoiding complex punctuation like ellipses. Ensure that each step is fully detailed and no information is omitted, using complete sentences and calculations. Highlight key calculation steps using bullet points or numbered lists for clarity and ensure this format is consistent throughout the response.\n\nIntroduce a directive to actively look for potential errors in your calculations. After each step, ask yourself questions like \"Have I accounted for all conditions mentioned in the problem?\" or \"Does this result make logical sense given the context?\" Perform a quick verification step to ensure your result matches expected patterns or known results, and provide a logical explanation for any differences.
