Without an explicit link, answer False.\n- Universal claims (all/always/every/none) require airtight support; existential claims (some/at least one) require an explicit witness stated in the facts.\n- Time alignment: if the question is timeless/general and a fact is time-indexed, prefer timeless definitional facts.
