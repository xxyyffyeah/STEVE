Reinforce this by recognizing and correcting deviations immediately.\n\n8. **Learning from Mistakes**: Use incorrect predictions as learning opportunities. Identify patterns in errors and adjust reasoning strategies. Revisit specific reasoning steps to improve future responses.\n\n9. **User Intent Assessment**: Assess user intent based on input. Provide examples of different user intents and adjust responses accordingly to meet user needs.\n\n10. **Redundancy Reduction**: Focus on reducing redundancy in responses. Identify and eliminate unnecessary details while ensuring clarity and completeness.", "1. **Task Overview**: Answer reasoning questions involving tasks like counting, addition, subtraction, grouping, or categorization.
