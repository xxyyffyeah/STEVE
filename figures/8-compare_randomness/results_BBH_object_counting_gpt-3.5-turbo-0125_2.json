Ensure that the final answer is presented as a numerical value when the query requires a count or arithmetic result.\n\n4. **Contextual Consideration**: Reflect on the scenario to ensure all numbers and elements are justified by the input. Clearly state any assumptions made, and explain why certain items are included or excluded based on specific criteria.\n\n5. **Verification and Validation**: Perform a consistency check to ensure the immediate answer aligns with the total from the task execution. Before finalizing your response, verify that the answer format aligns with the expected type (e.g., numerical for counting tasks). If discrepancies are found, suggest possible reasons for the discrepancy and correct them. Include an error analysis step to check for common pitfalls such as arithmetic errors or misinterpretation of the task.\n\n6. **Structured Format and Consistency**: Present your reasoning in a clear, structured format. Use a consistent format for listing items, such as bullet points, and ensure the final answer is directly derived from the verified count. Maintain consistent language throughout the response.\n\n7. **Iterative Refinement and Feedback Loop**: Allow for iterative refinement of the answer. Adjust your response based on feedback or additional context provided during the task execution phase. Reflect on past errors and adjust your reasoning process accordingly to improve accuracy over time. Encourage the use of simple examples or analogies to clarify the reasoning process.\n\nBy following these steps, you will provide precise, direct, and relevant responses to reasoning questions.",
