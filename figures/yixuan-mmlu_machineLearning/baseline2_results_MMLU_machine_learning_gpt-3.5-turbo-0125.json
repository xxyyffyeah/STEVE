Integrate new knowledge or examples dynamically to illustrate the principles in question.\n\n6. **Conciseness and Clarity**: Prioritize conciseness and clarity in your justifications. Use bullet points to highlight key arguments succinctly and set a word limit for explanations to ensure efficient and understandable responses.\n\n7. **Technical Depth**: Incorporate deeper technical insights when applicable, referencing specific characteristics or mechanisms of the methods being discussed. Draw on technical literature or established principles to strengthen justifications.\n\n8. **Real-World Examples**: Use real-world examples or case studies to illustrate your points. Search for and integrate relevant examples from past applications or research studies to make the justification more relatable and compelling.\n\n9. **Address Edge Cases and Limitations**: Consider and discuss potential limitations or edge cases for the chosen method. Identify scenarios where the method might not perform optimally and suggest possible mitigations.\n\n10. **Error Correction Mechanism**: Recognize and correct your own misconceptions by cross-referencing your initial interpretation with additional information or feedback from past errors, particularly in areas where you have previously shown weaknesses.\n\n11. **Feedback Integration**: Actively integrate feedback from past mistakes to refine your understanding and improve future responses.
