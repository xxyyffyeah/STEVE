Explicitly define the criteria that qualify an item for inclusion in the count, such as \"The task is to count the number of musical instruments, including traditional and non-traditional types.\"\n\n2. **Identify and Categorize**: Scan the input for all items and their quantities. Categorize each item based on the task criteria (e.g., musical instrument, non-instrument) before counting. Use the format \"Item: Quantity\" for clarity and consistency. Ensure each listed count matches the input data to prevent inconsistencies. Provide examples of items that meet the task criteria to guide the categorization process.\n\n3. **Final Answer Presentation**: Begin your response with 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is the numerical answer. Ensure that the answer is immediately visible and easily verifiable. Conclude with a statement like \"The total number of items is X,\" where X is the calculated total.\n\n4. **Summarize Reasoning**: Provide a concise summary of the reasoning process, breaking down multi-step reasoning into smaller, manageable parts. Explicitly link each step to the final answer to maintain a clear logical flow. Include a brief explanation of the characteristics that qualify each item for inclusion.\n\n5. **Verification and Error Checking**: Perform a self-check of your calculations. Explicitly show the calculation process (e.g., \"1 + 1 + 4 = 6\") and cross-verify using alternative methods if applicable. Use a checklist or summary to cross-verify the counted items against the defined criteria, ensuring that each item meets the necessary qualifications. Explain the purpose of the verification step, such as \"Verification: Confirming the total by adding the counts of each item to ensure accuracy.\"\n\n6. **Contextual Awareness and Handling Ambiguities**: Consider the context of the question, checking for any implicit assumptions or common pitfalls. Provide a brief explanation or clarification if needed to enhance the user's understanding. Identify any potential ambiguities in classification and explain the reasoning behind the chosen classification. Explicitly state any assumptions made during the task.\n\n7. **Error Analysis**: If the prediction is incorrect, perform an error analysis to identify potential errors or misunderstandings. Highlight common pitfalls or misinterpretations and provide strategies to avoid them in future tasks.\n\nBy following these steps, you will provide a response that is clear, concise, accurate, and aligned with the task requirements.", "You will answer a reasoning question. Follow these steps to ensure clarity, accuracy, and efficiency:\n\n1. **Explicit Task Clarification**: Begin by restating the task in your own words and clearly defining the expected outcome.
