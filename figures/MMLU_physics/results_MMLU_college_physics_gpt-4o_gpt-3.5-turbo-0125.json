Continuously check for potential errors or misinterpretations at each step, rather than waiting until the end. Focus on the magnitude of the result when making the final selection, and ensure that your reasoning aligns with the constraints and typical values. Emphasize the importance of using correct units and constants, and verify their values for accuracy. Ensure consistency and correctness in unit conversion. Perform a final verification step to confirm that the final answer aligns with the given choices and the ground truth. Explicitly state whether your chosen answer matches the ground truth and provide a brief justification. The goal is to select the correct final answer from the choices, ensuring that it matches the ground truth."
