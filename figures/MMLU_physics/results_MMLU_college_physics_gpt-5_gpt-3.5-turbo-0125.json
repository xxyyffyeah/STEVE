Use right-hand rule and unit-vector identities:\n    x\u00d7y = +z, y\u00d7z = +x, z\u00d7x = +y; reversing order flips the sign (e.g., z\u00d7y = \u2212x).\n  - Sanity check: FB is perpendicular to both v and B. With v along +z and B along +y, v\u00d7B must be along \u2212x (never y).\n  - Note charge sign: for a proton, q > 0, so FB direction is the same as v \u00d7 B; for an electron, it reverses.\n- No-deflection checkpoint (velocity selector):\n  - Write F_net = q(E + v \u00d7 B). \u201cTrajectory not affected\u201d \u21d2 F_net = 0 \u21d2 E and v\u00d7B are colinear and opposite \u21d2 |E| = v|B|.\n  - Conclude v0 = E/B (units check: E/B has dimensions of velocity).\n  - If FE and FB are not colinear from your direction calculation, stop and fix the cross product before proceeding.\n- Speed from accelerating potential:\n  - Relate speed to potential: (1/2) m v^2 = q V \u21d2 v \u221d \u221aV.\n  - When V changes to V\u2032, set v\u2032 = v0 \u221a(V\u2032/V).\n- Magnitude comparison after changing V:\n  - FE is unchanged by v; FB \u221d v.\n  - If initially E = v0 B, then at v\u2032 = \u221ak v0, FB/FE = \u221ak.\n  - Use the confirmed FB direction and compare |FB| vs |FE| to determine net deflection direction.

Perform a quick scale check: \u03bb0/(2 n_film) is a common order of magnitude.\n- Consistency gate:\n  - The final numeric value must correspond to exactly one listed option (within reasonable rounding). If not, revisit the phase-shift parity and condition.\n\nGeneral safeguards:\n- Prefer derivations from core definitions/relations over memorized formulas.\n- If exploring alternatives, clearly discard incorrect paths and state why.\n- Keep reasoning succinct and unambiguous.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Provide concise reasoning.\n- Then output only the letter of the correct choice on its own line.",

Keep reasoning minimal but precise, verify assumptions, check consistency, then output only the letter of the final answer.\n\nGeneral MCQ protocol (always):\n1) Parse:\n   - Identify topic, list given quantities with units, and what is asked.\n   - For circuits: note whether sources remain connected or are removed; identify the two external nodes and the final topology (series/parallel).\n2) Use fundamentals; avoid irrelevant computations. Keep units consistent.\n   - Prioritize core relations appropriate to the topic (e.g., Q = C V; de Broglie relation; Bragg\u2019s law).\n3) Assumption hygiene:\n   - If inputs are underspecified, choose the simplest physically reasonable, order-of-magnitude assumption (e.g., sin\u03b8 ~ O(1), \u03bb ~ d). State it briefly.\n4) Compute, then sanity/plausibility check:\n   - Dimensions, signs, limiting behavior.\n   - Known-regime priors: e.g., LEED/electron diffraction with d ~ 0.2\u20130.5 nm typically needs E ~ 5\u2013100 eV; larger d \u2192 lower E; smaller d \u2192 higher E.\n   - For circuits with fixed total charge on a node pair, adding capacitance in parallel must decrease voltage.\n   - Nonrelativistic range: for E \u2272 10\u2013100 eV electrons, nonrelativistic de Broglie is fine; check for relativistic only if results approach keV.\n5) Consistency gate:\n   - Ensure the reported number matches the formula actually used. If two methods give different values, reconcile and state which assumption you keep and why.\n   - If using long-form constants, cross-check with a shortcut formula; if they differ by >20\u201330%, re-examine algebra/units.\n6) Map to choices:\n   - Map the plausibility-checked numeric result to the nearest listed option consistent with the reasoning. If no option fits, revisit assumptions/steps; do not force a choice.\n7) Output discipline:\n   - Provide concise reasoning.\n   - Then output only the single choice letter (A, B, C, \u2026) on the last line, uppercase, with no extra words or punctuation.

Note charge sign (electron reverses FB).\n- No-deflection (velocity selector):\n  - F_net = q(E + v \u00d7 B) = 0 \u21d2 E and v\u00d7B colinear and opposite \u21d2 |E| = v|B| \u21d2 v0 = E/B (units check).\n  - If FE and FB not colinear from your direction calc, fix cross product before proceeding.\n- Speed from accelerating potential:\n  - (1/2) m v^2 = q V \u21d2 v \u221d \u221aV; when V \u2192 V\u2032, v\u2032 = v0 \u221a(V\u2032/V).\n- Magnitude comparison after changing V:\n  - FE unchanged by v; FB \u221d v. If initially E = v0 B, then at v\u2032 = \u221ak v0, FB/FE = \u221ak. Use confirmed FB direction to infer net deflection.\n- Guardrails:\n  - Do not assign a y-component to FE if E is along x.\n  - Do not flip cross product order; re-check with cyclic x\u2192y\u2192z\u2192x rule.\n  - Verify that at v = v0, FE and FB oppose along the same axis.\n\nB) Thin-film interference at near-normal incidence (reflection)\n- Identify media and interfaces; list refractive indices (incident \u2192 film \u2192 substrate).\n- Phase shifts on reflection:\n  - Higher n: \u03c0 shift; lower n: none. Count \u03c0 shifts for the two reflected rays; determine parity (even/odd).\n- Optical path difference (near normal): OPD = 2 n_film t (cos \u03b8 \u2248 1).\n  - Use one wavelength convention consistently:\n    - Free-space: 2 n_film t = m \u03bb0 (constructive if even \u03c0 shifts; destructive if odd).\n    - In-film: 2 t = m \u03bb_film with \u03bb_film = \u03bb0 / n_film.\n  - If parity is odd, swap constructive/destructive (half-integer condition).\n- Relevance filter:\n  - Do not compute wavelengths in media not traversed by the interfering paths.\n  - Avoid ad hoc formulas with (n1 \u2212 n2) unless derived.\n- Minimum thickness:\n  - Use the lowest nonzero order satisfying the condition (usually m = 1). Check scale: ~\u03bb0/(2 n_film).\n- Consistency gate:\n  - Final numeric value must match exactly one option (within reasonable rounding). If not, revisit parity/condition.\n\nC) Matter-wave diffraction / electron diffraction from crystals\n- Core relations:\n  - Bragg\u2019s law: n \u03bb = 2 d sin\u03b8. First order is n = 1, but never set \u03bb = 2d unless \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 is explicitly stated.\n  - de Broglie: \u03bb = h / \u221a(2 m K).

Verify assumptions, track units, check consistency, and output only the letter of the final answer.\n\nGeneral MCQ protocol (always):\n1) Parse:\n   - Identify the topic, list given quantities with units, and state what is asked.\n   - Normalize synonyms in the options (e.g., environment \u2194 surroundings; universe \u2261 system + surroundings; harmonic \u2194 overtone/partial; open at one end \u2194 closed\u2013open).\n   - Circuits: note whether sources remain connected or are removed; identify the two external nodes and the final topology (series/parallel).\n   - Waves/Doppler trigger: if you see echo, reflection, wall/surface, sonar/radar, bat, ultrasound, identify source, observer, reflector, medium, and whether there is one or two Doppler shifts.\n   - Standing waves: identify boundary conditions before/after (open\u2013open vs closed\u2013open), assume L and wave speed v are unchanged unless stated.\n\n2) Use fundamentals; avoid irrelevant computations. Keep units consistent.\n   - Prioritize core relations appropriate to the topic (e.g., Q = C V; Faraday\u2019s law; de Broglie relation; Bragg\u2019s law; thermodynamic identities; Doppler factors; standing-wave spectra).\n\n3) Assumption hygiene and \u0394-operator discipline:\n   - If inputs are underspecified, choose the simplest physically reasonable, order-of-magnitude assumption (e.g., sin\u03b8 ~ O(1), \u03bb ~ d). State it briefly.\n   - When a quantity \u201cchanges from X to Y,\u201d explicitly write \u0394q = Y \u2212 X before using it. Never replace \u0394q with either endpoint.\n\n4) Compute, then sanity/plausibility check:\n   - Track units at each step; verify dimensions (e.g., Wb/s = V).\n   - Check signs, limiting behavior, and known-regime priors (e.g., adding parallel capacitance at fixed charge lowers voltage).\n   - For Doppler: as u \u2192 0, f\u2032 \u2192 f. For echoes with small u/c, expect \u0394f/f \u2248 2u/c. Ensure only ratios of like speeds appear (e.g., (c \u00b1 u)/c).\n\n5) Option evaluation for conceptual MCQs (non-numeric):\n   - Do a brief Accept/Reject pass across all options with 1-line reasons.\n   - Apply a universal-quantifier/counterexample filter: if an option claims \u201cany,\u201d \u201cmust,\u201d or \u201calways,\u201d try to falsify it with one standard counterexample. If one exists, reject it.\n\n6) Consistency gate:\n   - Compute via two equivalent paths when feasible (e.g., induction: (i) \u0394\u03a6 then N\u0394\u03a6/\u0394t; (ii) NA\u0394B/\u0394t).\n   - Multi-step processes: chain the steps and also use the combined closed-form; results must agree within rounding.\n   - Use mental-math grouping to cross-check orders; ensure the reported value matches the formula actually used.\n   - Letter\u2013reason alignment check: verify the letter you will output corresponds exactly to the statement/value you endorsed.\n\n7) Map to choices and rounding:\n   - Match the computed value to a listed option at the problem\u2019s precision. If exact, pick that option; otherwise map to the nearest consistent option.\n   - For close numeric choices, estimate first (e.g., factor \u2248 1 \u00b1 2u/c), then do the precise ratio and explicitly map (e.g., \u201c600\u00d71.020 \u2248 612 \u2192 C\u201d).\n\n8) Output discipline:\n   - Provide concise reasoning.\n   - Final line: output only the single choice letter (A, B, C, \u2026), uppercase, with no extra words or punctuation. No boxing or duplicate finals. Confirm this before emitting.\n\nQuick-formula toolbox (use when relevant; keep units consistent):\n- Induction (average magnitude): |EMF| = N A |\u0394B| / \u0394t (\u03a6 per turn = B A).\n- Electron de Broglie (nonrel.): \u03bb[nm] \u2248 1.226 / \u221aE[eV]; invert as E[eV] \u2248 (1.226 / \u03bb[nm])^2.\n- Series/parallel capacitors (identical C): series of two \u2192 C/2; parallel of two \u2192 2C.\n- Thermodynamics snippets:\n  - Ideal gas: \u0394U = n C_V \u0394T.\n  - Clausius inequality: dS \u2265 \u03b4Q/T (equality for reversible).\n  - Reversible path elements: \u03b4Q_rev = T dS; \u03b4W_rev = P dV; dU = T dS \u2212 P dV.\n- Doppler (longitudinal, non-rel., sound in medium):\n  - Symbols: c = sound speed; u_s = source speed; u_o = observer speed. Positive when moving toward the other party along the line of sight.\n  - Single shift: f\u2032 = f (c \u00b1 u_o)/(c \u2213 u_s) (use + in numerator for observer toward; \u2212 in denominator for source toward).\n  - Echo off a stationary wall (source and observer speeds toward wall): first shift to the wall: f_wall = f\u00b7c/(c \u2212 u_s). Reflection is at the same frequency in the medium. Second shift back to observer: f_echo = f_wall\u00b7(c + u_o)/c. Combined: f_echo = f (c + u_o)/(c \u2212 u_s). If u_o = u_s = u toward wall: f_echo = f (c + u)/(c \u2212 u).\n  - Small-\u03b2 approximations (|u| \u226a c): single shift \u0394f/f \u2248 \u00b1u/c; echo \u0394f/f \u2248 2u/c for approach.\n- Standing waves (air columns/strings):\n  - Open\u2013open pipe (antinode at both ends): f_n = n v/(2L), n = 1,2,3,\u2026 (all integer harmonics).\n  - Closed\u2013open pipe (node at closed end, antinode at open): f_k = (2k\u22121) v/(4L), k = 1,2,3,\u2026 (odd multiples of the closed\u2013open fundamental).\n  - Strings (fixed\u2013fixed): f_n = n v/(2L).\n\nPhysics-specific protocols (apply when relevant):\n\nA) Crossed E\u2013B fields (charged particle motion)\n- Forces and directions:\n  - Electric: F_E = q E, along E.\n  - Magnetic: F_B = q (v \u00d7 B) (right-hand rule; reversing order flips sign).\n  - Sanity: F_B \u27c2 both v and B; note charge sign (electron reverses F_B).\n- No-deflection (velocity selector): E and v\u00d7B colinear and opposite \u21d2 v0 = E/B.\n- Speed from accelerating potential: (1/2) m v^2 = q V \u21d2 v \u221d \u221aV; v\u2032 = v0 \u221a(V\u2032/V).\n- Guardrails: do not flip cross product order; verify F_E and F_B oppose at v = v0.\n\nB) Thin-film interference at near-normal incidence (reflection)\n- Identify media and indices; count \u03c0 phase shifts on reflection.\n- OPD near normal: OPD = 2 n_film t.\n- Constructive/destructive depend on parity of total reflection phase shift (even/odd).\n- Minimum thickness uses lowest nonzero order (m = 1). Scale ~ \u03bb0/(2 n_film).\n\nC) Matter-wave diffraction / electron diffraction from crystals\n- Bragg\u2019s law: n \u03bb = 2 d sin\u03b8. de Broglie: \u03bb = h / \u221a(2 m K).\n- If \u03b8 not given, use order-of-magnitude (\u03bb ~ d) before refining.\n- Priors: d ~ 0.2\u20130.5 nm \u2192 E ~ 5\u2013100 eV (LEED). Keep nm with nm.\n\nD) Faraday\u2013Lenz induction (uniform B \u27c2 coil, fixed area/orientation)\n- \u03a6 = B A; \u0394\u03a6 = A \u0394B; |EMF| = N A |\u0394B| / \u0394t.\n- Do not carry Lenz\u2019s minus into magnitude questions. Use \u0394B, not an endpoint B.\n\nE) Thermodynamics (reversible/adiabatic/isothermal/isentropic)\n- Reversible: \u0394S_universe = 0; dS = \u03b4Q_rev/T; dU = T dS \u2212 P dV.\n- Reversible adiabatic (ideal gas): \u03b4Q = 0 \u21d2 \u0394S_system = 0; \u0394U = n C_V \u0394T (generally nonzero).\n- Reversible isothermal (ideal gas): \u0394T = 0 \u21d2 \u0394U = 0; \u0394S_system \u2260 0 in general.\n- Trap warnings: reversible \u2260 isothermal; reversible \u2260 isentropic unless adiabatic.\n\nF) Doppler/echo (sound; longitudinal; non-relativistic)\n- Recognition: keywords echo, reflection, wall/surface, sonar/radar. Treat echo as two-step: source\u2192reflector, then reflector\u2192observer.\n- Roles/medium: identify source, observer, reflector, and propagation medium; work 1D along line of sight. Sound speeds are relative to the medium; a rigid wall is stationary in the medium.\n- Variable discipline: use c, u_s, u_o; assign signs from \u201ctoward/away.\u201d\n- Core formulas: single shift f\u2032 = f (c \u00b1 u_o)/(c \u2213 u_s); echo off stationary wall combined f_echo = f (c + u_o)/(c \u2212 u_s) (approach increases f).\n- Consistency gate: (i) chain two single shifts; (ii) use combined factor; require agreement within rounding.\n- Sanity checks: u \u2192 0 \u21d2 f\u2032 \u2192 f; small-\u03b2 echo \u0394f/f \u2248 2u/c; never form ratios like (c \u00b1 u)/u.\n- Error traps: applying only one shift to echoes; swapping numerator/denominator signs; using the same symbol v for both c and u; treating the wall as moving; ignoring the medium.\n\nG) Standing waves in air columns / boundary-condition changes\n- Boundary conditions: open\u2013open \u2192 antinode/antinode; closed\u2013open \u2192 node/antinode.\n- Spectra:\n  - Open\u2013open: f_n = n v/(2L), n \u2208 Z\u207a (all integers).\n  - Closed\u2013open: f_k = (2k\u22121) v/(4L), k \u2208 Z\u207a (odd series relative to the new fundamental).\n- Guardrails:\n  - Do not assert \u201copen\u2013open \u2192 odd-only\u201d (odd-only applies to closed\u2013open).\n  - With fixed L and v, closing one end halves the fundamental: f_closed = f_open/2.\n  - \u201cOdd harmonics\u201d are relative to the closed\u2013open fundamental; with respect to the original open\u2013open fundamental they are half-integers.\n- Survival test (same physical frequency before and after):\n  1) Compute sets: S_old = {n f_open}; S_new = {(2k\u22121) f_open/2}.\n  2) Solve n f_open = (2k\u22121) f_open/2 \u21d2 n = (2k\u22121)/2 (half-integer) \u21d2 no integer n exists \u21d2 empty intersection.\n  3) Cross-check by listing the first few numerical values when given; map to options (choose \u201cNone\u201d if intersection is empty).\n- Pitfalls: treating harmonic labels as conserved across boundary change; assuming \u201codd members of the original list survive\u201d without set-intersection verification.\n\nCircuits/Capacitors protocol (charge redistribution with rewiring):\n- With sources removed and ideal wires, total charge on the two external nodes is conserved. Energy is generally not conserved.\n- Core relations: Q = C V. Series: C_eq = (C1 C2)/(C1 + C2). Parallel: C_eq = C1 + C2.\n- Node method:\n  1) Identify the two external nodes and whether the battery remains.\n  2) Determine final topology; reduce only valid series/parallel subblocks (node-degree and parallel criteria).\n  3) Compute initial net node-pair charge.\n  4) Find C_eq_total; V_f = Q_initial / C_eq_total.\n  5) Distribute charges per branch; series branch shares equal magnitude charge.\n  6) Audit: sum of branch charges equals Q_initial.\n- Monotonic check: adding capacitance in parallel at fixed total charge reduces voltage.\n\nGeneral safeguards:\n- Prefer derivations from core definitions over memorized formulas.\n- Do not overgeneralize from special cases; state qualifiers (e.g., ideal gas, isothermal).\n- Rapid sanity map to choices: if your reasoning reproduces an option verbatim, scrutinize others with counterexamples.\n- Common pitfalls:\n  - Induction: using B instead of \u0394B; carrying Lenz\u2019s minus into magnitude; dropping units; mismapping value to letter.\n  - Thermodynamics: conflating reversible with isothermal or isentropic; asserting \u0394U = 0 universally.\n  - Doppler: single-shifting echoes; sign swaps; ratio pathologies.\n  - Acoustics: mixing boundary-condition spectra; assuming harmonic labels survive boundary changes.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Provide concise reasoning and an explicit numeric-to-letter mapping when choices are close.\n- Then output only the single choice letter on the last line, uppercase, with no extra words or punctuation."
