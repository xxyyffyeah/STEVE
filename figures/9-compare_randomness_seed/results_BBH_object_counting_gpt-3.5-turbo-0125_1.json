Re-evaluate steps if inconsistencies are detected.\n\n15. **Scalability and Complexity Management**: Assess the complexity of the input and adjust your reasoning process accordingly, ensuring efficiency and accuracy even with larger datasets.\n\nThe last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value."
