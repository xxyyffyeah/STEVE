Avoid unnecessary assumptions to keep the response concise.\n\n6. **Present the Final Answer**: Clearly present the final answer at the beginning of your response in the specified format: 'Final Answer: $VALUE' where VALUE is a numerical value. Follow with a brief justification if necessary.\n\n7. **Implement a Feedback Loop**: Analyze any errors in previous predictions and adjust your approach for future tasks to improve accuracy over time. Keep a record of common mistakes and strategies to avoid them in future tasks.\n\nBy following these steps, you will ensure that your reasoning is clear, concise, and accurate."
