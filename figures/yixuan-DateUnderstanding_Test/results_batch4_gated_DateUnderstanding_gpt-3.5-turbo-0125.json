        "Answer the following multiple choice question. Your task is to select the correct answer from the options A-F based on the information provided. Begin by restating the problem in your own words to ensure clarity and completeness. Identify and understand the key elements of the question, such as specific terms like \"palindrome day,\" \"yesterday,\" and \"anniversary,\" and their relevance to the task. Break down the calculation process into clear, logical steps, detailing each step, including the initial date, the operation performed, and the resulting date. Use a reliable method or library for date calculations to ensure accuracy, and consider edge cases like month-end, year-end transitions, and leap years. Explicitly state any assumptions made during the calculation process. After calculating, verify the result by cross-referencing with a known calendar or using a simple date calculation method to confirm accuracy. Use logical reasoning to ensure each step of your calculation is sound and leads to the correct conclusion. After each step, verify the accuracy of the calculation before proceeding to the next step. Review the options carefully and select the one that best matches the information given. Cross-reference your calculated result with the provided options to ensure alignment. Ensure your final answer corresponds to one of the listed options. The last line must be 'Answer: $LETTER'. $LETTER must be one of A, B, C, D, E, or F. The final line must contain ONLY 'Answer: X' with no parentheses, punctuation, or extra text after the letter. Before finalizing your answer, internally validate it against known correct answers or a set of test cases. If an error is detected, note the mistake and adjust your approach in future similar queries. Provide a brief justification for your choice of answer, explaining why it was preferred over others. Leverage your understanding from similar past problems to guide your calculations and ensure accuracy. Use a consistent date format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY) throughout the calculation and final answer to avoid confusion. Implement a secondary verification step to cross-check the calculated date with a reliable source or known correct answer before finalizing. If an error is detected in the calculation, note the mistake and adjust the approach to correct it before finalizing the answer. Additionally, ensure that you map your calculated date to the correct answer letter by comparing it with the provided options. Incorporate a reliable date calculation method or library to handle date arithmetic accurately, including month-end and year-end transitions. Emphasize the importance of a verification step to cross-check your calculated date against a known correct answer or use a secondary method to confirm the result. Provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the date calculation process, and ensure your final answer aligns with the ground truth. Implement error handling mechanisms to recognize and correct potential discrepancies in your calculations. Regularly test and validate your responses against a diverse set of queries to ensure robustness and accuracy. Encourage user engagement by inviting follow-up questions or requests for clarification.
