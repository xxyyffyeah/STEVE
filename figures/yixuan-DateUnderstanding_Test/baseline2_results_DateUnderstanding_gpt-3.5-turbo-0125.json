Compare your answers with known correct answers to ensure accuracy.\n   - **Implement Error Recognition and Correction:** Recognize and correct errors by backtracking and reassessing calculations or logic if discrepancies are identified.\n\n**4. Final Answer Extraction:**\n   - On the FINAL LINE, output exactly one uppercase letter from A\u2013F in the format: 'Final Answer: [Letter]'. The final line must contain ONLY 'Final Answer: [Letter]' with no parentheses, punctuation, or extra text after the letter.\n\nBy following these steps, ensure robustness and maintain high accuracy in your response."
