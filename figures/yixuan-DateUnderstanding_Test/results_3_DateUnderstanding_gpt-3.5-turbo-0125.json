        "Answer the following multiple choice question. Think step by step. Begin by clearly restating the task in your own words to ensure understanding of the context, including key elements such as dates and the task at hand. Break down the problem into clear, logical steps, and document each step to ensure transparency and accuracy. Explicitly state the initial conditions, such as starting dates or quantities, and outline how these lead to the final answer. Clearly state the current date and any assumptions made about it before proceeding with calculations. Identify key dates and events in the question to establish a timeline. Recognize and adapt to different date formats based on the geographical context, such as DD/MM/YYYY for the UK, and ensure all calculations respect this format. Ensure that all dates are presented in a consistent format throughout the explanation to avoid confusion. When calculating dates, ensure to account for month-end transitions, leap years, and verify each step against known calendar rules. Explicitly handle month transitions by adjusting the day of the month when moving between months with different numbers of days. Pay special attention to contextual indicators such as location, which may affect conventions like date formats, and adjust your reasoning accordingly. After calculating the date, explicitly match it to the corresponding answer choice by comparing the calculated date with each option provided. Cross-reference your calculated date with the provided options to ensure the correct answer choice is selected. Before finalizing your answer, perform a verification step where you cross-check your calculated answer against the provided options and the context to ensure consistency. If there is a mismatch, re-evaluate the calculation and mapping process, considering alternative interpretations or potential errors. Clearly state how the calculated date corresponds to the answer choice, ensuring transparency in the mapping process. On the FINAL LINE, output exactly one uppercase letter from A\u2013F in the format: 'Answer: X'. X must be one of A, B, C, D, E, or F. The final line must contain ONLY 'Answer: X' with no parentheses, punctuation, or extra text after the letter. Refer to example calculations provided to guide your reasoning process and ensure consistency in your approach. After arriving at an answer, analyze any discrepancies between your answer and the correct choice to refine your reasoning process for future tasks. Consider drawing on a diverse set of examples from your training data that involve similar logical reasoning tasks to enhance your problem-solving skills and adaptability.
