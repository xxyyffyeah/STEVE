      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Reconstruction**: Even if reconstruction was necessary, the current implementation is incorrect. The `max_length` variable is being decremented, which will cause the function to return incorrect results. This highlights the importance of thoroughly testing and verifying the correctness of the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inefficient Use of Space**: The code uses an additional list `lis` to store the reconstructed subsequence, which is not necessary. This can be removed, and the space complexity can be improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Redundant Operations**: The code uses slicing and reversing operations (`lis[::-1]`) to return the length of the subsequence. These operations are redundant and can be avoided by directly returning the maximum value from the `dp` array.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Lack of Input Validation**: The code does not validate the input sequence. It assumes that the input is a list of integers, but it does not check for this. Adding input validation can improve the robustness of the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Variable Naming**: The variable names `n` and `dp` are not descriptive. Using more descriptive names can improve the readability of the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Code Organization**: The code can be organized into separate functions for calculating the `dp` array and returning the maximum value. This can improve the modularity and maintainability of the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Type Hints**: The code does not use type hints for the function parameters and return type. Adding type hints can improve the clarity and readability of the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Docstrings**: The code does not include docstrings to describe the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. Adding docstrings can improve the documentation and usability of the code.\n",
